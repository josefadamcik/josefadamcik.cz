<h2 id="about">Who am I?</h2>
<p>I am an experienced software developer. I am open to new professional opportunities at the moment.
<a href="resume.html" class="resume">My resume.</a>
<h2 id="quick">Quick facts about me</h2>
<ul>
<li>I recently moved to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/u33nHboXYpP2" target="_blank"><strong>Dortmund (Germany)</strong></a> and I am not willing to relocate. 
<li>Although you can find many interesting <a href="resume.html">keywords in my resume</a>, I&nbsp;focus on <strong>Android development</strong>, at least for the time being. So no, I&nbsp;would have no interest in either PHP, JavaScript, or JavaEE related offers.
<li>I speak Czech (native), English (proficient). I don't speak German. <span class="supressed">I&nbsp;am learning, but it will take some time until I&nbsp;will be able to communicate on professionally reasonable level.</span>
<li>I have been ~12 years in software development and ~5 years in Android development. <span class="supressed">Honestly, I&nbsp;don't remember exactly when I&nbsp;have started with Android development.</span>
<li>I perceive myself as a self-reliant problem solver, humble craftsman and permanent learner. I value gradual improvement over big restarts/rewrites. I believe that clean code, automated testing, code reviews, CI/CD and other good practices are crucial parts of high-quality software development, but the most important thing is to deliver value. <span class="supressed">And also I am a bit shy guy, so please, try not to scare me.</span> 

</ul>
<h2 id="interested">What am I interested in?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Permanent, on site role in an English speaking team in Dortmund or nearby. <span class="supressed">I am sorry, but I do not consider 2 hours of commute (or more) daily as "nearby".</span> 
<li>Permanent, fully remote role in an English speaking team anywhere in Europe. <span class="supressed">You should know, what you can expect from remote cooperation and you should be able to handle it. Remote is harder than on-site for all parties involved.</span>
<li>Freelance contract, fully remote, communication in English or Czech. <span class="supressed">Details would be negotiated individually.</span>
</ul>
<h2 id="mycode">My projects</h2>
<p>I have a showcase project, so you can check out some code I wrote recently. Please, keep in mind that it's just a toy project I have been working on in my spare time. So it's not perfect, it has only limited functionality etc.
<ul>
<li><a  href="https://github.com/josefadamcik/TrackOnTrakt">TrackOnTrakt (Github)</a>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/cz.josefadamcik.trackontrakt">Download from Play Store</a> <span class="supressed">You'll have to opt-in for an alpha testing.</span>
</ul>
<p><br>There are, of course, projects that I had developed when I was working for my former employer. However, I feel that it's not perfectly professional to present them publicly, as my personal references. 
<h2 id="you">Want to hire me?</h2>
Do you think I may be useful part of your team? Do you have an offer that fits the criteria mentioned above? Feel free to contact me. <span class="supressed">But please, try do be more specific, than: "I would like to have a call with you". Thank you.</span>
