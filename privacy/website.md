# Privacy policy

This website is operated by [Josef Adamcik](https://josef-adamcik.cz/). You can contact me on email [josef.adamcik@gmail.com](josef.adamcik@gmail.com).

## Cookies and embedded content

This website **does not** use any cookies. This website **does not** embed any content from 3rd parties.

## Usage tracking

This website **does** contain a simple website traffic tracking which allows me (Josef Adamcik) to analyze website's usage statisticaly and use the results to improve the website itself. 

This simply means, that when you visit this site, the system will store: 

- the website from which you visited us from
- the parts of our site you visit
- the date and duration of your visit
- your **anonymised** IP address
- information from the device (device type, operating system, screen resolution, language, country you are located in, and web browser type) you used during your visit.

The tracking is not done by any third party service, but by a custom installation of the [matomo](https://matomo.org) software. The software is configured to be as most privacy friendly as possible:

- it does not use cookies
- it does not store your full IP address, only anonymized version.
- it respects [Do Not Track (DNT)](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) settings in your browser and therefore it's very easy to opt out.

### Tracking opt out

Open your browser's settings, find a privacy section and look for a setting with label containg "Do Not Track", or "Ask website not to track me." or similar. Alernatively you can use the [privacy badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) an extension by [eff.org](https://eff.org)
