## Who am I?

I am an experienced software developer. I am **NOT** open to new professional opportunities at the moment.

## My projects

### ActivityJournal

Work in progress training project (android application). For more [information check this series of blogposts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-27-activity-journal-app-idea %}).


### TrackOnTrakt

Older showcase/training project.

Please, keep in mind that it's just a toy project I have been working on in my spare time. So it's not perfect, it has only limited functionality etc.

*   [TrackOnTrakt (Github)](https://github.com/josefadamcik/TrackOnTrakt)
*   [Download from Play Store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/cz.josefadamcik.trackontrakt) You'll have to opt-in for an alpha testing.


### Other

There are many smaller projects [on my github](https://github.com/josefadamcik)
.

There are, of course, projects that I had developed when I was working for my former employer.
