### ActivityJournal

### TrackOnTrakt

Older showcase/training project (abandoned)

Please, keep in mind that it's just a toy project I have been working on in my spare time. So it's not perfect, it has only limited functionality etc.

*   [TrackOnTrakt (Github)](https://github.com/josefadamcik/TrackOnTrakt)
*   [Download from Play Store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/cz.josefadamcik.trackontrakt) You'll have to opt-in for an alpha testing.
