The concept of playing TTRPGs alone sounds very odd and very appealing at the same time. This post is about how is my relationship with solo RPGs developing.

I am very socially anxious person, therefore playing TTPRPG solo is very appealing concept for me. However, it does sound weird. Am I going to be sitting at the table, rolling dice and talking to myself? How that could work? Solo RPGs, mainly [Ironsworn][ironsworn] and [Ironsworn: Starforged][starforged] are huge part of [my personal TTRPG renaissance][pnp].


## How I started

I started as soon as [Starforged][starforged] released. I was late to join the Kickstarter, I was event too late for the "late pledge", but I bought the physical copy as soon as the store opened and therefore got the PDFs. I dove right in.

[I even started capturing my first Starforged experience in written form on this blog. It has so far 10 episodes.][valentin] I moved on and started playing other characters but I am quite sure I'll return to Valentin Sikorski, the space courier soon. 

My first gaming setup was in front of my computer. PDF with the book and captured my sessions in [Stargazer][stargazer]. Stargazer is very nice web application for solo play of Starforged. It can run in fully offline mode, even on mobile devices, has moves reference, all the oracles for random generation, star map and a possibility to write down journal entries. It's truly amazing application which keeps getting better. 

## First struggles

One of the big things each solo player has to figure out for themselves is how they capture their sessions (and if). For me writing is the obvious choice. Talking to myself would feel much weirder and could be annoying to people around me and that would limit the possible times when I could play. Just imagining things in my head also didn't feel good enough. 

However, I type quite fast on my keyboard so it felt like an obvious choice. And because I have a blog, I could even publish it, couldn't I? I am well aware that no one is actually going to be interested in the resulting text. But I like to write down things around me as some kind of diary of my projects, what I did and learned. I don't do it for others, but for myself. That was always the case. And if someone stumbles upon my ramblings and finds them interesting? Well, that's indeed nice, but not required. So I approached my solo play in the same way. 

[You can read the results.][valentin] It's a weak prose. Partly because English is my second language, partly because I didn't want to invest to much time into producing it and also, I am no writer. 

We have already stumbled upon one interesting point: I imagine and capture the story in English, even though It's my second language. Why? Mostly because I can, partly because I wouldn't be interested in publishing it in Czech language (see, I am writing it for myself and still prefer to use global language so more people could actually read it. Silly, isn't it? Oh those humans). Nevertheless, it is very difficult to switch languages in your head when playing a game where the rules and all the oracles you use to spark your imagination are in English. This extra translation hoop makes it actually worse. Thankfully my English is good enough so I can thing in the language and have my internal monologue in it. So it's not that hard to play the game. I did realize that my "sci-fi and fantasy adventure vocabulary" is much weaker then I would like it to be. That makes it quite an effort to capture the story in writing without feeling like it sucks on all levels.

And here we are running into the **first big struggle** I had. I kept spending time writing the prose, editing the prose, fixing typos, looking up synonyms and words I didn't know. I felt my game is going forward slowly and it's actually quite some work to progress. That was sucking some enjoyment from the game and I started wandering how could I improve that. 

Theoretically it should be possible to stop writing the prose. Take just few notes. Sum up scenes and dialogues in a sentence or two. But how to achieve it when I sit in front of my computer and have [my Sofle keyboard in front of me with all the typing and editing power][sofle]?

## Getting outside

Another struggle I had was to find the time when I would enjoy playing while sitting in front of my computer. I work from home-office and sit on the chair full time. Often I just hate the idea to stay sitting there for fun. 

Thankfully [Stargazer][stargazer] runs offline. So I took my Chrome tablet, downloaded the PDFs, installed Stargazer and outside we go. My beloved partner Anna likes to paint during our trips and walks and that's perfect time when I could play. I was hoping this could also help me to write less. The keyboard for the tablet is terrible, the layout is far from what I am used to and it slows me down significantly.

It worked only partially. I liked the ability to play outside, but typing on the tablet was pain and I was still in the "I am going to put this on blog" mood so I would just spend more time editing when I got home. ANother issue I had is that I had to keep switching between PDF's and Stargazer and search for things in PDF's. It ended up to be inconvenient and fiddly. Also, typing on the tablet when it sits on the lap (while sitting on a bench or in public transport) is very uncomfortable because it's just too low and it tends to slide down from my short legs.

## Getting analogue

{% responsive_image path: images/solorpg/PXL_20220802_180703932.jpg  alt:"" figcaption: "Short beer and play session on the Tempelhofer Feldin Berlin" %}

I stumbled upon [Traveler's Ironsown][travelers]. It's a very nice set of cards with move reference for the [Ironsworn][ironsworn] game meant to be used with a traveler's notebook in the 11&nbsp;x&nbsp;21&nbsp;(cm) format. It also includes characters sheet and other sheets to support the play. 

I hesitated a bit. First, the sci-fi Starforged is much closer to my heart and I wasn't sure how much I am going to enjoy it's fantasy predecessor. But the main concern was writing by hand. I knew it would certainly slow me down since I type everything on my keyboard nowadays, including all my work notes, todo-lists, shopping lists. Everything. I almost forgot how to write cursive and I have never really been good at it. But I was intrigued. 

You can see from the images around, that I tried. I ordered a nice journal with inserts from Amazon (essentially, the same you see on the pictures on the DrivethruRPG page of [traveler's Ironsworn][travelers]). I bought few nice gel pens of various colours.

I printed the traveler's Ironsworn, of course, and the move references for Starfoged (which I later replaced by a preview of traveler's Starforged from [Colin's Patreon][terriblybeautiful])
I found a nice mobile app that would allow met roll dice when it's not practically to roll real ones. I printed the asset and delve cards in smaller sizes so I could just glue them into my journal.

I didn't have any of the books in physical form. I had the move references, but the oracles and foes are quite useful as well. Of course, I could always use my phone and check a pdf there. But that wasn't working really well. 

I ended up taking quite some effort to put together and print small booklets with oracles and foes for both Ironsworn and Starforged. Using various PDF manipulations programs I took the pages and ordered them in the documents as I wanted. For Ironsworn I combined pages from both the main Ironsworn book and Ironsworn: Delve. The page numbering is obviously wrong but they are still much easier to use than PDF.

{% responsive_image path: images/solorpg/PXL_20220808_212414642.MP.jpg  alt:"" figcaption: "Ironsworn and Ironsworn: Delve oracles and foes combined into two small booklets" %}

For Starforged, I just selected pages I wanted. There's much more oracles and I used better paper (all the amazing illustrations are awesome for flavour) so I had to split the oracles into four smaller booklets. I used PDF X-Change editor which has not only "print as booklet" feature but also "book mode" which can split the document into multiple "signatures". That saved me some work, although, if I had to do it again I would rather use some better way how to split the oracles into multiple booklets so they are organized by theme. Now they essentially should be bound into a small book with four signatures which I didn't do.

{% responsive_image path: images/solorpg/PXL_20220808_212634812.jpg alt:"" figcaption: "Starforged oracles (4 small booklets) and foes" %}

I ended up taking quite some effort to put together and print small roughly A6-sized booklets with oracles and foes for both Ironsworn and Starforged. Using various PDF-manipulation programs, I took the pages and ordered them in the documents as I wanted. For Ironsworn I combined pages from both the main Ironsworn book and the Ironsworn: Delve supplement. 
Nevertheless, this really gave me a lot of freedom to play at various places and in various situations. I have played on plain, trains, in cafes, or just sitting in the nature.

I got used to writing by hand again and it went so far that I even write a personal journal by hand now. I still tend to write a bit more narration while playing than I hoped for but at least I don't obsess about formulations and editing. The fact that the written text is harder to change helped me a lot.

{% responsive_image path: images/solorpg/PXL_20220918_160105405.jpg  alt:"" figcaption: "Playing Ironsworn in a cafe in Edinburgh" %}

I played quite a bit of Ironsworn while on vacation in Scotland and I must say that imagining the story of Asha, who rescues her sister from a raider camp, while sitting among hills above Edinburgh or taking a break in cafe in the city of Edinburgh was amazing.

I was so happy with the experience I even laminated the Traveler's Ironsworn cards.

I appreciate the offline and compact setup at home as well. I can just play on my balcony or even in bed. Sometimes it's a bit of mess with all the cards, booklets and pens around but the experience suits me much better than on a tablet or computer. 

## Other struggles and learning how to play solo

Playing solo is demanding from many aspects. I had to figure out what stories I want to create and what kind of fun I seek. But I also had to unlearn a bit and train my self to approach things differently. There was a lot of thinking about playing, reading about playing and lurking in discords while other people discussed playing involved (and still is) in the process. 

### Failures, fail forward and building of story

Ironsworn is designed in a way that it inserts complications when a roll fails (miss) or successes only partially (weak hit). The probability distribution of rolls is carefully picked to support this. It's most common to get the "weak hit" and misses are quite probable as ell. It's sort of "fail forward" approach we see in many other games. It works really well but it can be also very frustrating when the player is not completely into it.

At the begging I was a bit frustrated when I didn't roll "strong hit". I was aware of what is the game trying to do an why, but often I would hate the outcome because I imagined the story going somewhere else. 

I would say there's were roughly 2 sources of this frustration:

First, I wanted to **be good in the game** and succeed in a similar way how I would like to succeed in a computer game. It's interesting, that I don't have this urge when I play a TTRPG game with a GM. But in solo I had it. I just didn't want to fail. Starforged doesn't really work if you can have fun only when you roll well all the time. As a GM a do prefer players who can "roll with the punches" and I thing games when failure is celebrated are better. But somehow I had to learn (and I am still learning) how to actually appreciate this in solo play. On the other hand, it's certainly a good training for any other TTRPG game I could play in the future.

Second, I got too attached to the direction I wanted the story to go to. I would imagine certain goal I want to achieve with the character (e.g. Valentin Sikorski wanted to infiltrate a secret factory) and the step they would get to get there. Then I would play and the game would throw complications and twists on me and I would be upset I am being distracted or doing something else than I wanted (e.g. Valentin is doing an expedition and dealing with perils on the way instead of just going there and doing something to fulfil the wov.)

The second one is a bit trickier to deal with and it was the main reason why I paused Valentin's story and tried to play other characters. I decide to try to just make a character and give them simple vow and avoid thinking about where it could go in the future. I also started trying to avoid complicating the story myself. The game can do it on it's own very well and If I add too many complications myself, it might be harder to figure out, what the next complications introduced by the game should be. I tried couple of characters and it worked much better. It requires some learning and training and I am still trying to improve, but being really able to let the story flow and just wonder where it goes is amazing and I suppose it's the experience a player should have in this game.
