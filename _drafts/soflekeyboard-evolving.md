It's been half a yer since I published my articles telling a story why and how I modified an existing desing for a split DIY keyboard (Lilly58) and created one tailored to my preferences - SofleKeyboard. I already started to experiment with more modifications.

## Layout changes

You may have noticed it on the photo above already. The bottom row is moved slitgly to the center and the 3 outer keys are aligned in colums. This allowed me to move outer colums down up bit. The stagger of the main part is a bit more aggresive in general.

Those are only slight changes, nothing revolutionray. But I have been using the new layou for few months already and I do like it a bit more. I don't feel like I would need to change it more, though.


## Experiments and simplifications

For the original version most of the layout and routing was taken from the Lilly58. I just modified a bottom row a bit and changed how Pro-Micro and other parts are connected.
