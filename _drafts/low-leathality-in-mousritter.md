## Low-leathality in Mausritter

In my group, there are two players only. They are not influenced by previous pen-and-paper experience and they are not gamers so they haven't created the habit of using in-game violence to resolve situations. One of the players is even very anti-violence because the setting full of little sentient animals makes her really feel for them. It was clearly stated by her that death of character or even dear NPCs is something that we should avoid so we essentially established line & veil on violent death. The other player would be willing to use the violence more often yet still less often than an average player, I would say.

Mausritter is based on Into The Odd and the system itself leads to quick combats with real consequences. The combat rules and combat relate equipment have significant representation in the rules. The book warns players that combat will be difficult and consequential ("Combat is dangerous business for mice, even brave adventurers. But sometimes it cannot be avoided.") and than the dying is part of the game ("Fight dirty. Run. Die. Roll a new mouse."). The attacks in Mausritter always hit (there's only damage roll). So how can we run a low-lethality game in Mausritter? Is it even possible? 

### What Mausritter gives you mechanically

HP - hit protection in Mausritter (and Into The Odd family of games in general) is a quickly refreshing resource representing the ability of character to avoid real harm. We can imagine it being something like stamina that allows character to dodge attacks etc. It can be (partly) refreshed after each combat during a short rest. When hit protection is depleted the character is being injured for real and their STR stat is being lowered according to the damage left. After each hit to the stat the character has to roll a STR save and if they fail they are removed from combat but alive ("take injured condition and are incapacitated until tended to by an ally and take a short rest". Rules as written, the character dies when their STR gets to 0 or lower.

That means that loosing hit protection doesn't mean harm is being done. It is easy to miss because our brains tend to treat this meta currency in the same way as hit points in other games. It's also a bit contradictory to the claim that in Mausritter "attack always hits". That claim is mainly trying to teach a player that they roll only once for their attack and the dice is based on their weapon. The way how I like to frame it is that the one roll and the hit protection value together approximate both "will I hit?" and "how much I harm them?" questions. 

This gives us several important things already:

- Loosing a lot of HP is very good signal to player that the combat is going to be serious for them.
- Every real harm can have already remove character from combat without dying immediately
- There is also "If an incapacitated creature is left untended for 6 exploration Turns, they die." There's an hour to save an incapacitated friend.

This gives GM a lot of tools to keep the lethality low. Player characters and NPC are actually quite likely to survive the combat and can be saved by friends or captured by enemies. Even if an incapacitated player character is abandoned by fleeing player characters there's usually possible to find a reason why the enemies would keep them alive: having leverage, to interrogate, exchange for ransom and many others. Even the enemies that just want to eat them could maybe store them for later (quite common trope in stories we watch and read). 

### House rules

The one **house-rule** I would suggest, is to basically ignore the part when they die if the STR reaches 0. Take it as a signal to make the consequences hard and impact-full, but let them live. 

For example:

- There can be some permanent scaring or body damage. Make sure it's fine at your table. Loosing a limb or an eye can be already very hard consequence for character which will stay with them for the rest of their life and it'll can already have very strong emotional impact on their player.
- They can be removed from the play for long time. For example because of serious injury that will be healing for long time. Or they could end up in coma. If magic ins involved there are practically no boundaries (maybe their soul is captured in an artefact and their body will sleep until the characters figure out how to break the artefact). Player would have to create a new character (as if their character died) and it can be be again very emotional for them. But it gives room for the character to come back later (maybe there's a magical cure or somebody who can be convinced to remove the curse from them etc.) The players can have a quest and work on getting the character back and than the player can choose which they want to play.
- An alternative to this is some kind of emotional damage. Maybe the character is going to be so traumatised they'll never go on adventure again. This requires buy in from the player and I wouldn't enforce it by giving the choice "they die or this". I would rather seek agreement that the outcome of the situation should have serious consequences and offer this as one option. The player would be invited to imagine character's "living in peace for the rest of their days". It can be interesting way how to keep the character as NPC somewhere in safety but getting them out of play.


### What about NPCs and their death?

The same rules as for mice apply. So there's is plenty of room for saving and capturing them when the fight ends. Together with the house rule above it's easy to remove death from the picture in most of the cases. 

Another important piece of rules is morale. Rules as written say that: 

"Whenever an antagonist is in a battle with the mice and
reaches one of the following conditions, it must make a
WIL save. On failure, the creature must flee or surrender. 1) Is obviously outmatched at the start of a battle, 2) Takes critical damage for the first time, 3) Sees an ally flee or fall

Easy to forget this piece but it has significant impact on the game. Combat can quickly end because enemies just run away after the first one fell. It can snowball pretty quickly, one would even say maybe too quickly. 

For example: the first enemy takes a critical damage and manages to stay in combat but fails morale save and flees. Others roll because they see him running away. Some of them run also. This should trigger another roll for the remaining ones so it's very likely all of them run away. That feels too much for me and I tend to roll only once per NPC and round.

### The GM

I personally want any situation to have a non violent solution no matter what players want. I am not really interested in emulating combat heavy games where "attacking" or being "attacked" is the default. So it's natural for me that I am always trying to:

- Avoid encounters where characters are immediately attacked.
- The antagonists are not cruel murder-hobos (they are not eager to finish incapacitated enemies just because they can).
- Let characters have an escape route: multiple paths through dungeons and other locations and don't block the escape path unless they actually make a mistake and kind of do it themselves.
- Try to make everyone they meet possible to talk to or interact non-violently. Easier with intelligent beings but they can still lure an animal away using some food or scare them away by making weird noise or something.
- Support their play-style by giving them appropriate spells and items. Instead of "sword that burns the attacked with magical fire", give them "a magical baton that stuns the opponent on critical hit". Or instead of the "fireball" spell they can find "invisible ring".
- Remind them if they got stuck and miss some basic opportunity ("you can still run away", "you can try to disarm them").

### The players

The players should support this by playing their characters accordingly. If they are afraid of their characters dying, they should choose solutions where they don't risk dying. If they don't want to kill NPCs they should try really hard to avoid doing harm do them in combat. 

If you feel they are not doing that, talk it through. Everyone at the table should be on the same page and try to create such game. There is still room for some in-character variance. For example, one character is trying to convince other's they should use more violence, other's disagree and propose non-violent way. As always, make sure the disagreements are handled on the appropriate level (in character versus out of character). Are they sill role playing their characters having an argument or is it a manifestation of a mismatch in the expectations among players?

### How it works?

So far it worked quite well for us. Until now, they have killed couple of skele-rats, blew up a giant snake and killed re-animated moth queen (controlled by magical fungi). Even when they got into fight they often focused on other goals than killing enemies. We have gone through most of the adventures in [The Estate][estate] and some home brew adventures.
