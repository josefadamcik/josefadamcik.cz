If you asked me a year ago to learn C++, I would politely refuse. Now I am (re)learning it. 

## There are so many programming languages

I have been working as software developer for circa 12 years and I know several languages. Java is my daily bread, but I have significant experience with ECMAScript (AKA JavaScript) and PHP. I met at least briefly many others: Kotlin, Python, Dart, TypeScript, Ruby and so on.  

My first experiences with programming, when I was a young boy, were Basic on my father's ZX Spectrum+, later Quick Basic on his laptop and finally Borland Turbo Pascal, which I managed to obtain somehow. 

TODO: school and university

## C++


So I bought a book.
