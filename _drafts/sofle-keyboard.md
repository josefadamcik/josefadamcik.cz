In the first article I explained my experience with custom keyboards and my requirements regarding desired layout for DIY keyboard. I have also promised there will be another article featuring a custom keyboard with such layout. Behold, this is SofleKeyboard - a 6Ã—4+5 keys column-staggered split keyboard with encoder support. Based on Lily58, Corne and Helix keyboards.
