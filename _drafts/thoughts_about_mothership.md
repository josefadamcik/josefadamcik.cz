The biggest connundrum of the game is the **horror** label. I think it's a poor choice firstly because people can't even agree what horror means so it doesn't help to set the expectations and after some experience from running the game and thinking about it I must agree with [Quinn from Quinns Quest][quinsmothership] that Motheship is not even trying to do horror, but tension (so maybe **thriller**?). What I take from the **horror** is expectation that the story is going to be deadly (high stakes), unfairnes (the thrat faced by characters is going to be overpowered and almost impossible to beat) and some tropes like final-person (the story is good when the only last survivor manages to escape the threat just barely). I also like the notion that the author runs the games mostly like escape rooms but I am not sure I want to stick to it.
