# Kit quality

I am far from being expert on scale model kit quality. However, the kit was so terrible that even I could tell. Somehow I expected Revell to have some decent standard. Molding was very low quality, it seemed that moulds shifted and a lot of plastic leaked between them so a lot of cleaning was necessary, the mold-lines very apparent. 

Fit of the parts was a joke. For example this is how assembled fuselage looked.

Sometimes location of injection marks didn't really makes sense.
