I don't even remember how it happened but recently I have got an idea to revisit one of former hobbies of mine. 

When I was a kid I was quite interested in planes. I ended up building few scale model kits. I have never really got good at it and If I remember correctly I managed to paint only one one of them. Somehow I didn't have enough patience to develop skills to get a decent result.

It might be interesting to try again now, few decades later, maybe I am patient enough? I bought a cheap Revell model kit of Space shuttle Atlantis, glue, paints and other accessories and started exploring.

# Kit quality

I am far from being expert on scale model kit quality. However, the kit was so terrible that even I could tell. Somehow I expected Revell to have some decent standard. Molding was very low quality, it seemed that moulds shifted and a lot of plastic leaked between them so a lot of cleaning was necessary, the mold-lines very apparent. 

Fit of the parts was a joke. For example this is how assembled fuselage looked.

Sometimes location of injection marks didn't really makes sense.

Let's say this created a lot of opportunities for me to learn how to utilise putty and how to sand. 

# Filling and sanding

Part of my order was Revell Plasto Bodyputty. I was a bit surprised by the product, somehow I expected something more along the lines of thick acrylic paste. Instead I have got quickly drying glue-like putty. Of course, this is not fault of Revell rather of my  ignorance. I had quite some trouble to figure out how to use it. But what I messed up when using putty, I fixed with more sanding.

The most problematic part was around the cockpit window.

The next step was a coat of grey primer. I have used some grey primer from Edding in a spray can I had around from before. I am not sure if it was a good idea since I had a lot of problems with the primer peeling off later.

As they say, the primer revealed problems and I went' through another iteration of sanding and filling followed by second coat of primer.

# Painting and first airbrush experience

My girlfriend had a barely used cheap airbrush and compressor set laying around so I tried to airbrush main colors. 

Learning was quite rough. The low-quality equipment combined with lack of skills and poor choice of pains lead to a lot of confusion and frustration. I had only Revell Aqua colors which are not really made for airbrushing and are very thick. A lot of thinning is required and that's one of the details which requires quite some experience. Youtube videos and online articles are not enough to learn it, one has to try and fail.

Another interesting detail I have learned the hard way is that white paints tend to have now coverage properties. That's certainly the case for Revell Aqua colors. 

Eventually a managed to do a basic white coat. You can see on the picture that it is quite rough and matt. Still not sure if it is just how the given paint works or if it's fault of process of tools.
