## Pen & Paper role-playing games, or table top role playing games

Interesting thing that happened to me in the last years, as I am getting older (38 at the time of writing) is that I am returning back to the hobbies I had (or almost had) as a kid or teenager.

I have played a bit of Magic The Gathering, I made [some][shuttle] [models][snowspeeder] and [dioramas][xwing], I have got into micro-electronics (which wasn't truly my childhood hobby but it was part of my education).

## Mausritter

First, I came across [Mausritter][mausritter] while some people mentioned the game in unrelated discussion group. In this game players play a little sapient mouse going on adventures. It's still the "sword and sorcery" RPG we know very well from other games, but re-flavoured into something quite different. 

I bought a copy and convinced my partner and a friend to play it. Since then wee have been playing a campaign in The Estate (an official adventure set for Mausritter). We had a lot of fun which my partner documents in game in her painted diary.

## Obsession

I did what I did with any of the hobbies mentioned above: reading about how to run games, how to play games. Joined many discords, where I mostly lurk and observe other people talking about TTRPG games. I started buying and reading rules and supplements for various games. I have discovered very rich and amazing subculture of Indie TTRPG games. Amazing word full of amazing ideas and games I would love to play.

Mausritter itself is based on Into The Odd and that lead me to other games like Electric Basionland, Cairn, Liminal Horror. I bounced into game families like Powered By The Apocalypse (PBtA), Forged in the Dark (FitD) and many other. I collected dozens of PDFs, quite a few physical books and pledged on many crowdfunded products. I bet they'll keep coming long after I get bored of the hobby and move on something else.

One of the very interesting branches of TTRPG games I have discovered are solo games. It sounded as a very odd idea to play a game solo but also as a very appealing idea for a socially anxious person who lives in a foreign country and doesn't speak the local language fluently (yes, me)

## Ironsworn & Ironsworn: Starforged

I have already published several posts with my  while playing Ironsworn: Starforged.
