## Layout - Work in progress

Corne has much less keys than my Katana60. I am still curious if I will be able to get used to it. The plan is to create a layout which is kind of close to my current Katana60. I have already started using it at home. For work I am going to keep using Katana60. My [Katana60
layout](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/katana60/keymaps/josefadamcik) has, at the moment, 4 configurations I can switch in runtime - Colemak Mac, Colemak Win, QWERTY Mac and QWERTY Win. I am going to add another configuration which will mimick my Corne layout - all keys which are not present on Corne will be deactivated and the remaining will do exactly the same. This will allow me to start getting used to the layout in work too while still having the ability to switch to the old layout and stay productive. As soon as (and if) it flips and I am more productive with Corne I'll take it to work and build another one for home.

So far [my layout (qmk source) can be found here](https://github.com/josefadamcik/qmk_firmware/tree/wip_crkbd/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/josefadamcik).
