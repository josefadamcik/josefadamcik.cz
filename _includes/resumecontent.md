### Profile {#profile}

 I perceive myself as a self-reliant problem solver, humble craftsman and permanent learner. I value gradual improvement over big restarts/rewrites. I believe that clean code, automated testing, code reviews, CI/CD and other good practices are crucial parts of high-quality software development, but the most important thing is to deliver value. <span class="supressed">And also I am a bit shy guy, so please, try not to scare me.

### Skills {#skills}

* Android development
  : I am a skilled Android developer with deep knowledge of Java and Android platform. I keep eye on new trends and technologies (e.g. Kotlin, Flutter, React Native).

* Back-end development
  : I have experience in API design and back-end development in PHP (Symfony) and Java (Spring, Hibernate, JSF). Due to my focus on Android development, some of my skills in this area might require a slight refresh.

* Web front-end development
  : Although my skills in this area are a bit outdated, I had had a strong knowledge of JavaScript and related technologies in the times before React changed everything.

### Experience {#experience}

Freelance
: *Android developer*
  __2018-current__
  I help companies with their software projects.

Smarcoms
: *Software developer*
  __2006-2018__
  I worked for Smarcoms for almost 12 years. I started as a student and continued my career in the company after I had finished my degree. The comapany changed a lot during all those years and I met a lot of developers, learned a lot of technologies a participated in many interesting projects. 
  
  I started as a website developer (PHP, Symfony) but I soon moved to other projects. 

  I was part of a team which developed a mid scale Java web application - booking system for sportcenters called [Bizzy](http://e-rezervace.cz). My role was a fullstack developer and I worked with technologies like Java, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, Richfaces, PostgreSQL, Tomcat.
  
  Next big project was mobile application [Shopin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.smarcoms.nakupnicentra) - czech mall/retail guide. The application consisted of: backend with API, webapp for administering, several services for data gathering, and two mobile apps for Android and iOs. Mobile applications started as hybrid HTML5 apps supported by Cordova (formerly phonegap) and later evolved to into native applications. I participated as a lead backend developer and hybrid mobile app developer, later as native Android developer. Technologies were: PHP, Symfony, Java, JavaScript, Python, MySQL and others.
  
  There were many other smaller projects I worked on. I developed several Android applications for several clients, built backends for those applications (or helped to build them). I helped to support legacy projects of our clients and solved various problems our clients had trouble with. I grew into a "go to" person for most of my colleagues.
