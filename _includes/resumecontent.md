### Profile {#profile}

  I perceive myself as a self-reliant problem solver, a humble craftsman and a permanent learner. I value gradual improvement over big rewrites. I believe that clean code, automated testing, code reviews, CI/CD and other good practices are crucial parts of high-quality software development, but the most important thing is to deliver value.

### Skills {#skills}

* Android development
  : I am a skilled Android developer with deep knowledge of Kotlin, Java and Android platform. I keep eye on new trends and technologies.

* Back-end development
  : I have experience in API design and back-end development in PHP (Symfony) and Java (Spring, Hibernate, JSF). Due to my focus on Android development, some of my skills in this area might require refresh. I have also dipped my toe into server-less world (Firebase Firestore, Cloud Functions) and Node.js recently.

* Web front-end development
  : Although my skills in this area are a bit outdated, I used to have very solid knowledge of JavaScript and related technologies in the times before React changed everything.

### Experience {#experience}

Olmero
: *Senior Sotware Engineer*
  __2021 Apr - current__
  After the disassembly of the mobile team I was offered another role in Olmero. This involves mix of full-stack development in various technologies and devops. My responsibility is to help modernize software and infrastructure in the company.

Olmero
: *Senior Android developer*
  __2018 Oct - 2021 Apr__
  Olmero is a Swiss company which aims to connect the construction industry. I was part of a mobile team which had been working on the [OLMeRo android application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.olmero.jo&hl=en). The app itself allowed companies to manage the construction process and collaboration among contractors right at the construction site (plans, defect and task management, logging). The development of the app was discontinued after the company was sold to a new owner who decided to focus on another portion of business. This eventually led to a disassembly of mobile teams.

Freelance
: *Android developer*
  __2018 (Mar-Oct)__
  I helped companies with their software projects.

Smarcoms
: *Software developer*
  __2006-2018__
  I worked for Smarcoms for almost 12 years. I started as a student and continued my career in the company after I had finished my degree. The company changed a lot during all those years and I met a lot of developers, learned a lot of technologies and participated in many interesting projects. 
  
  I started as a website developer (PHP, Symfony) but I soon moved to other projects. 

  I was part of a team which developed a mid-scale Java web application - booking system for sports centres called [Bizzy](http://e-rezervace.cz). My role was to do a full-stack development.  I worked with technologies like Java, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, Richfaces, PostgreSQL, Tomcat.
  
  Next big project was a mobile application [Shopin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.smarcoms.nakupnicentra) - Czech mall/retail guide. The application consisted of a backend with API, web app for administering, several services for data gathering, and two mobile apps for Android and iOs. Mobile applications started as hybrid HTML5 apps supported by Cordova (formerly PhoneGap) and later evolved to into native applications. I participated as a lead backend developer and hybrid mobile app developer, later as a native Android developer. Technologies were: PHP, Symfony, Java, JavaScript, Python, MySQL and others.
  
  There were many other projects I worked on. I developed several Android applications for various clients, built backends for those applications (or helped to build them). I helped to support legacy projects of our clients and solved various problems our clients had trouble with. I grew into a "go to" person for most of my colleagues.
