Because [I enjoyed my last scale model build a lot][shuttle] I have quickly started working on another one. This time I picked a StarWars snowspeeder kit by Bandai. I always liked the aesthetics of StarWars and I am more interested in building sci-fi and space related models rather than historic planes and tanks. 

Bandai kits have a great reputation and since I was hugely disappointed with the quality of the shuttle model made by

## The kit

The kit is Snowspeeder by Bandai in 1:48 scale. I have got it quite cheaply (under 20 eur) from a local distributor. Internet is full of reviews of this kit and it is very popular. 

There are the usual things everybody repeats about the kit: very fine and crisp details, very good fit. It can be build without glue just by snapping parts together and it works surprisingly well. There's a sheet a water slid decals and a sheet on sticker for people who just want a simpler building experience without painting and complicated fiddling.

I must admire the engineering that went into designing the kit. The parts are carefully designed to snap in only into the right place and in the right orientation and that helps to avoid many mistakes. The seams are usually natural part of the model (the act as a panel line) and even mould lines are almost not present or in a place where they are hard to spot. Therefore only minimal amount of sanding is require and I didn't have to fill in anything with putty.

Most of the time I spent with the model was about painting and weathering. It can be put together very quickly. 

## Painting plan

My aim was to explore some weathering techniques with this model. I wanted to start with simple things. So I wanted to do:

- airbrush for basic coat and the coloured strips
- brush painting to add a bit of variation to panels
- paint chipping with "the basic" technique - using paint and a sponge
- acrylic wash for panel-lines
- Tamiya Weathering Master pigments for final weathering.

Eventually I have added some weathering with oils and oil wash, more about that later.

There'll be time to try other techniques with next models. I would also like to make small dioramas for the models in the future but that would be too much for the second model I picked.

## The sources of inspiration

I have spent some time going through photos and videos of other people who build the model. I got a lot of inspiration from them. I did some research about how the on screen models for the movies looked as well but I didn't really try to be accurate in that regard. 

I must mention two sources since I kept returning to them through the build:

- build by Andy Moore. It's amazing build of the model with a nice hangar scenery. [Forum thread with the process here][andymoore] and [his Flickr album here][andymoore2].
- and 2 builds by John Bius who [wrote about his first build on his website][biusweb] and made [videos about the second one][biusyoutube].

## Build log

### Cockpit and crew

Inspired by other I started by painting the cockpit. I didn't expect much from myself. I believed that my shaky hands would prevent me from painting any detail and lack of experience wouldn't help as well. 

All the part (including pilots) were primed by airbrush with gloss black primer from Valejjo. The rest was painted by hand with some dry-brushing. Finished with acrylic wash from Valejjo.

The kit has a lot of details for cockpit but I didn't use them. I did use decals for pilots.

I was very surprised what I was able to do with the cockpit. It's certainly not perfect, but I wouldn't hope for more. I am less happy with the pilots. They are more on the terrible side and kind of what I expected.
