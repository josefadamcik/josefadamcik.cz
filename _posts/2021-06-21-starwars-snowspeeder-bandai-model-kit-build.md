Because [I enjoyed my last scale model build a lot][shuttle] I have quickly started working on another one. This time I picked a StarWars snowspeeder kit by Bandai. I always liked the aesthetics of StarWars and I am more interested in building sci-fi and space related models rather than historic planes and tanks. 
a
Bandai kits have a great reputation and since I was hugely disappointed with the quality of the shuttle model made by Revell as [I wrote in the build log][shuttle], i wanted to try a kit with very good reputation to have some comparison.

And just to make to context clear: this is my second scale model I am building  after I got back to the hobby after more than 20 years long break. It's the 3rd plastic model I am going to paint in my whole life. And it is the first one I'll attempt to weather.

## The kit

The kit is Snowspeeder by Bandai in 1:48 scale. I have got it quite cheaply (under 20 euro) from a local distributor. Internet is full of reviews of this kit and it is very popular. 

There are the usual things everybody repeats about the kit: very fine and crisp details, very good fit. It can be build without glue just by snapping parts together and it works surprisingly well. There's a sheet of water slide decals and a sheet of stickers for people who just want a simpler building experience without painting and complicated fiddling.

I must admire the engineering that went into designing the kit. The parts are carefully designed to snap in only into the right place and in the right orientation and that helps to avoid many mistakes. The seams are often a natural part of the model (the act as a panel line and similar) and even mould lines are almost not present or in a place where they are hard to spot. Therefore only minimal amount of sanding is require and I didn't have to fill in anything with putty. I could imagine using some putty here and there if I was going for perfection, though.

Most of the time I spent with the model was about painting and weathering. It can be put together very quickly. 

## Painting plan

My aim was to explore some weathering techniques with this model. I wanted to start with simple things. So I wanted to do:

- airbrush for basic coat and the coloured strips
- brush painting to add a bit of variation to panels
- paint chipping with "the basic" technique - using paint and a sponge
- acrylic wash for panel-lines
- Tamiya Weathering Master pigments for final weathering.

Eventually I have added some weathering with oils and oil wash, more about that later.

There'll be time to try other techniques with next models. I would also like to make small dioramas for the models in the future but that would be too much for the second model I picked.

## The sources of inspiration

I have spent some time going through photos and videos of other people who build the model. I got a lot of inspiration from them. I did some research about how the on screen models for the movies looked as well but I didn't really try to be accurate in that regard. 

I must mention two sources since I kept returning to them through the build:

- build by Andy Moore. It's amazing build of the model with a nice hangar scenery. [Forum thread with the process here][andymoore] and [his Flickr album here][andymoore2].
- and 2 builds by John Bius who [wrote about his first build on his website][biusweb] and made [videos about the second one][biusyoutube].

## Build log

### Cockpit and crew

Inspired by other I started by painting the cockpit. I didn't expect much from myself. I believed that my shaky hands would prevent me from painting any detail and lack of experience wouldn't help as well. 

{% responsive_image path: images/snowspeeder/primed_cockpit.jpg alt:"Primed cockpit parts" figcaption: "Primed cockpit parts" %}


All the parts (including pilots) were primed by airbrush with gloss black primer from Valejjo. Then they got another airbrush coat with some dark grey (forgot which paint it was, but it might have been Tamiya German grey). The rest was painted by hand with some dry-brushing. A toothpick ended up being a very valuable tool for the small buttons. Finished with acrylic wash from Valejjo.

{% responsive_image path: images/snowspeeder/PXL_20210509_180835793.jpg alt:"Painting figures is hard."  figcaption:"Painting figures is hard."%}

The kit has a lot of details for the cockpit but I didn't use them. I did use decals for the pilot helmets. I struggled with the ones for the visors and I broke one later when moving the pilot around. 

I was very surprised what I was able to do with the cockpit and very happy with the result. It's certainly not perfect, but I wouldn't hope for more.

I am less happy with the pilots. They are more on the terrible side and kind of what I expected. All of that is going to be barely visible since the cockpit is going to be closed. It was very good practice and fun, though.

### Snowspeeder's back

Very straightforward process: 

- airbrushed black gloss primer
- the main back part airbrushed with the same dark grey as the cockpit
- dry brushed with gun metal acrylic by Tamiya
- hand painted some details
- acrylic wash by Valejjo




### Basic paint job for the fuselage

The colour of primer is already quite nice grey. To add some variety, I have masked some panels and sprayed over with Valejjo light grey. 

Once I removed the masking tape I realised the light grey is too dark and the contrast too much. Mixing very light grey (Valejjo light grey and a lot of white) and airbrushing over was an easy fix and the variance in color of panels was preserved. 

The kit contains decals for the stripes on the fuselage. They are dark grey and the same is the box art. I wanted to have something more visible so I mixed a red colour. I don't remember how, the basic colour was Valejjo red and I added a bit of others I had until I was happy.

Given how the model is designed I was able to paint some small pieces without masking and assembling them later. They are already from a plastic of a different colour (for the low effort variant of the build when someone doesn't want to paint it all). 

Some masking was necessary for the rest but nothing difficult. Again a nice practice for me. I did manage to mess one detail up. You may notice already on the picture, but I haven't until I 

### Paint chipping and variance

I know there are many ways hot to create a chipped-paint effect on models. For this model, I decided to stick with one the most basic ones. Just a bit of paint and a piece of sponge (I have used the coarse part of the dishwashing sponge).

I did try the technique a little bit on 2 scratch build bot's I have made recently so it wasn't my first try. 

The first pass was using the same colour mix I used to paint the main fuselage and create chips for the red paint.

The second pass was with the Valejjo light grey to create chips for the rest of the snowspeeder.

Overall I am pleased with the result even though there are certainly some places where it could be better (mainly on the bottom).

### Weathering and finish

### Lessons learned

1) It's important to learn how to resolve mistakes and don't be upset about them. They'll happen. Weathering steps are able to hide a lot of problems. Panel-lines also help to hide some sub-optimal hand painting.

2) Details which look terrible from up close can be perfectly fine from a normal distance the model is going to be seen. 

3) With all the washes and weathering the model will get significantly darker. It's important to keep this in mind when doing the basic paint job.

4) Triple check how you mask thins. Masking the part that should be actually covered with paint is an oversight that can happen to anyone. But not noticing until the model is assembled and almost done is plain stupid.
