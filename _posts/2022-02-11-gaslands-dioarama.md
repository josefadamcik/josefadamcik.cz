A build log for a Gaslands inspired vehicle with a piece of terrain.

I have started this project last year. This build was [again][beadbots] a challenge for Patroens by [Bill Making Stuff][bill]. The challenge was to build a [Gaslands][gaslands] vehicle build. [Gaslands][gaslands] is a tabletop post-apocalyptic game inspired by Mad Max. The idea is to take a regular toy car (Hot Wheels etc.) and make it look post-apocalyptic and ready for a deadly race. 
I made the car at the time the challenge was taking place. I have added a piece of terrain later at the end of the year. It wouldn't really make sense for the game itself. But it was a good opportunity to learn a bit about how to create a basic piece of terrain and it makes it more interesting to display on my shelve.


This post is mostly pictures of the build process.

## Building the terrain

So far I have built only a piece of [snowy terrain][snowspeederterrain] for my [Star Wars Snowspeeder][snowspeeder]. I plan to make more complex and difficult sceneries in the future. So I figured I could try something simple for this build as well just to learn some techniques. The main inspiration in the process comes from another YouTube channel I like a lot [Boylei Hobby Time ][boyleihobbytime]. Check him out, he makes awesome things.

Originally, I planned to convert more of the cars I bought. But so far I didn't feel the inspiration and I moved onto other projects.
