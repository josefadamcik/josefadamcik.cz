Another Bandai kit of a vehicle from StarWars. Crashed after an emergency landing.

The previous StarWars vehicle I built was [Star Wars Snowspeeder][snowspeeder] which I eventually placed flying over a piece of [snowy terrain][snowspeederterrain].


For the X-wing I wanted to do something different and decided to go with a heavily damaged, crashed vehicle.
