There's nevere enough hobbies for Josef. I particular I do enjoy revisiting the hobbies I had and left in my younghood. Recently I dove into the world of Pen And Paper adventures, or table top role playing games, if you say so. Most of that is theoretical - reading through interesting game systems and settings. There's a little bit of actuall play as well. But today I would like to focus on solo play. I have only recently noticed that it is a thing to play TTRPG on your own. And when I read Ironsworn rules, I realized I am indeed interested in trying it out. Maybe only if the setting was maybe sci-fi?
