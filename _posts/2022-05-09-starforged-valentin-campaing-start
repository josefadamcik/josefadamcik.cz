[Starforged][starforged] is TTRPG game with focus on narative and wery vel designed for (not only) solo-play. This post is first in a series of my play reports. Let's see which stories are going to unfold.

<!--more--> 

There's never enough hobbies for Josef. I particular I do enjoy revisiting the hobbies I had and left in my younghood. Recently I dove into the world of Pen And Paper adventures, or table top role playing games, if you say so. Most of that is theoretical - reading through interesting game systems and settings (oh my god, there're so many interesting system out there!). There's a little bit of actuall play as well. But today I would like to focus on solo play. I have only recently noticed that it is a thing to play TTRPG on your own. And when I read [Ironsworn][ironsworn] rules, I realized I am indeed interested in trying it out. Maybe only if the setting was maybe sci-fi...

Well, [Starforged][starforged], a Sci-Fi iteration of [Ironsworn][ironsworn] was released last Friday (digitally). Both games are made by Shawn Tomkin and they are amazing. Like really, everything about the games is. They are worth every cent (and the original book of Ironsworn is veen free to download).

I don't really want to waste space and time by describing what the game is about. There are plenty of sources which are going to do much better job at that. If you don't know the game, I suggest to read at least the information on [the website][starforged] to have a rough idea before proceeding. Maybe watch and actuall play video or something along those lines, I do not plant to go into explaining how the mechanics of the game work. 

I am eager to explore the game and stories it could help to create, though. I figured, I could write down some kind of play report, maybe a journal of the character as they go through the campaign. I am not going to attempt to write a high-quality prose because that requires a lot of effort an focus. But I'll try to make it at least a little bit readable. 

``
Apart form the narative, I am also going to share the steps in the mechanical sense of the game: the moves and rolls I am making and their results. 
These are going to be in code blocks as this parapraph is. They are not going to make much sense, unless you actually now how the game works mechanically. But they illustrate how the narrative is supported by the game's mechanics.

## Session 0 - truths, starting sector and character

The first part is all about preparating the setting for the game and the character. 
"Truths" are facts (or at aleast, things that are assumed to be facts) about the universe the story is going to take place. My truths are chosen as fallows (note that the text of the thruths is copy/pasted from the game rules and shared under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license], they are created by Shawn Tomkin)

### Cataclysm

**We fled the ravages of a catastrophic war.** Over millennia, we consumed resources and shattered lives as we fueled the engines of industry, expansion, and war. In the end, a powerful foe took advantage of our rivalries in a violent bid for power. Fleeing the devastation, we assembled our fleets and traveled to the Forge. A new home. A fresh start. In this final war, we were set upon by: Self-replicating nanomachines

### Exodus

**Mysterious alien gates provided instantaneous one-way passage to the Forge.** In the midst of the cataclysm, our ancestors found a strange metal pillar on our homeworld's moon. A map on the surface of this alien relic detailed the deep-space locations of the Iron Gatesâ€”massive devices which powered artificial wormholes. With no other options, the Exodus ships fled through the gates and emerged here in the Forge.

### Communities

**We have made our mark in this galaxy, but the energy storms we call balefires threaten to undo that progress, leaving our communities isolated and vulnerable.** Starships navigate along bustling trade routes between settlements. We've built burgeoning outposts on the fringes of known sectors, and bold spacers chart new paths into unexplored domains. But this hard-earned success is threatened by the chaotic balefires, intense energy anomalies which cut off trade routes and threaten entire planets.

### Iron

**Iron vows are sworn upon totems crafted from the enigmatic metal we call black iron.** Black iron was first forged by a long-dead civilization. Some say it is a living metal, attuned to the hidden depths of the universe. Remnants of this prized resource are found within ancient sites throughout the Forge. It is resistant to damage and corrosion, but can be molded using superheated plasma at specialized facilities. The Ironsworn carry weapons, armor, or tokens crafted from black iron, and swear vows upon it.

### Laws

**Laws and governance vary across settled domains, but bounty hunters are given wide latitude to pursue their contracts. Their authority is almost universally recognized, and supersedes local laws.** Through tradition and influence, bounty hunter guilds are given free rein to track and capture fugitives in most settled places. Only the foolish stand between a determined bounty hunter and their target.

### Religion

**Our faith is as diverse as our people.** Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears as a way of connecting to their roots. Some idealize the natural order of the universe, and see the divine in the gravitational dance of stars or the complex mechanisms of a planetary ecosystem. And many now worship the **Primordials**â€”gods of a fallen people who once dwelt within the Forge.

### Magic

**Supernatural powers are wielded by those rare people we call paragons.** While not magic in the truest sense, the abilities of the paragons are as close to magic as we can conjure. These powers are born of  **Magitech augmentations**.

### Communication and Data

**Information is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to transport messages and data across the vast distances between settlements.** Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space of a ship or outpost are impossible. Digital archives are available at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that data safely to its destination. 

## Medicine

**To help offset a scarcity of medical supplies and knowledge, the technicians we call riggers create basic organ and limb replacements.** Much was lost in the Exodus, and what remains of our medical technologies and expertise is co-opted by the privileged and powerful. For most, advanced medical care is simply out of reach. When someone suffers a grievous injury, they'll often turn to a rigger for a makeshift mechanical solution.

### Artificial Intelligence

**We no longer have access to advanced computer systems. Instead, we must rely on the specialists we call Adepts.** Our computers are limited to simple digital systems and the most basic machine intelligence. This is because: **AI was outlawed in the aftermath of the machine wars**. The Adepts serve in place of those advanced systems. They utilize mind-altering drugs to see the universe as a dazzling lattice of data, identifying trends and predicting outcomes with uncanny accuracy. But to gain this insight they sacrifice much of themselves.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Robots and artificial assistants (like overseer module in a ship) are driven by very complex programs and systems based on machine learning but they are not truly sentient artificial intelligence.
</aside>

### War

Those few with the ability to pay can call on the Legionâ€”a guild of professional soldiersâ€”to defend or expand their holdings. The rest of us are on our own. The Legion deploy skilled fighting forces and well-equipped starships on-demand. But their service always comes at a dire cost, and the members of the Legion are mercenaries who hold no loyalty except to the highest bidder.

### Lifeforms

**This is a perilous and often inhospitable galaxy, but life finds a way.** Life in the Forge is diverse. Planets are often home to a vast array of creatures, and our starships cruise with spaceborne lifeforms riding their wake. Even animals from our homeworldâ€” carried aboard the Exodus shipsâ€”have adapted to live with us in the Forge

## Precursors

**Over eons, a vast number of civilizations rose and fell within the Forge. Today, the folk we call grubsâ€”scavenger crews and audacious explorersâ€”delve into the mysterious monuments and ruins of those ancient beings.** Incomprehensible technologies, inexorable time, and the strange energies of the Forge have corrupted the vaults of the precursors. Despite the perils, grubs scour those places for useful resources and discoveries. But some secrets are best left buried, and many have been lost to the forsaken depths of the vaults. 

### Horrors

**Put enough alcohol in a spacer, and theyâ€™ll tell you stories of ghost ships crewed by vengeful undead. Itâ€™s nonsense.** Within the Forge, space and time are as mutable and unstable as a flooding river. When reality can't be trusted, we are bound to encounter unsettling phenomenon.
