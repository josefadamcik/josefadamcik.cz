I have mentioned the group I started playing with last year in [my previous post][berlingroup]. Since the beginning of the year, I've had a blast playing around 15 games with the group, and I ran three games myself (two games of Mothership and one of Alien RPG).

The group celebrated two years of its existence in April. Yes, there was a party, and yes, there were games. We also published a zine called [Every Wednesday WE roll volume 2 (You can grab it for free on itch)][ewwr2]. It's the second issue; the first one was released last year and is [also available on itch][ewwr].

The zine is small and humble but packed with good stuff. You can also read more about the group in both zines. My contribution is a short adventure for Mothership called "Dreams of Candyhill". It's just three A5 pages long, and I took it as a challenge to pack as much as I could within this space and wrote the adventure in a rather short time.

And a small note: it does have Mothership stats for NPCs, but apart from that, it should be easy to incorporate into other games and even worlds. I can imagine this being a present-day Liminal Horror investigation or a cyberpunk mission, maybe for CY_BORG or any other cyberpunk game you fancy.

I think it might be worth improving the layout for readability and investing more time into making it better overall. It's possible that in the future, I'll create a newer, bigger version and publish it as a standalone module. But for now, enjoy what is there.
