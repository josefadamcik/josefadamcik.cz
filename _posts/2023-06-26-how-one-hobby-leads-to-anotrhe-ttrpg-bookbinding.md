I am still into TTRPGs (or PnP if you wish), you can red about how [I resurrected this old hobby of mine last year][pnp]. My two-player real life group just finished their Mausritter Campaign, I play reguralry at several open tables online and I even managed to overcome my anxieties and join a couple of real life games here in Berlin. And I plan to play (and run!) more.

Part of the hobby is reading and collecting games, rulebooks, adventures and other modules. I must admint I do buy more than I could ever use in play. Sometimes I buy physical books but often they are only digital. I still like to have something physical in my hand so often I print things on my ancient printer (Cannon MP550). I am not even sure how old it is, but it's quite surely at least 10 years. I started with A5 pamphlets. They are very easy to print and assemble. 

You print two A5 pages per A4 sheet, double sided and the only tricky part is that the pages must be ordered prpoerly on the sheets. Some digital downloads now contain, apart from the "normal" PDF also a PDF where you get 2 pages per a4 sheet in landscape. However, those are usable only in digital since they ordering is not usable when printing. The pages are in their natural order and that works when readin online but when printing you would have too keep them as loose sheets. You cannot fold and staple them into a "zine" (pamphlet). There are excetions who provide the "booklet" version ([Liminal Horror][liminal] for example has such a version). Nevertheless, most of the time it's up to you. Thankfully there's planty of sotfware that has this feature, usually called "print as booklet" or "booklet mode". You can certainly find it in Adobe Acrobat Reader and PDF XChange editor (which I mostly use nowadays).

The assembly is theen straightforward. Fold them in half, staple or sew in the middle and maybe cut excess paper on the edges.

You can see above that I printed plenty over the time, including the two I wrote and my partner illustrated (both for Mausritter, [The Whites][whites] and [Chrismous forever][chrismous]. I also made some [A6 booklets with Ironsworn and Starforged oracles][ironsworn] to support my offline solo play.

Eventually, I came across books I wanted to print but they had too many pages for a pamphlet. I thaught, that it can't be that hard to assemble them into multiple sections (or [signatures][wikipedia]) into a full book place it into a cover. I am certainly no strange to DIY crafts so I started some research. It's common with me that I start with the idea of doing a quick job but then I spiral into the topic and spend more time researching and watching videos, fallowed buy buing a lot of tools and supplies to finally get to waht I wanted to do in the first place. So for some time I had been obsessed by bookbinding videos, almost exclusively from the [youtube channel Das Bookbinding][dasbookbinding] (don't worry, it's in English), which is amazing and captures a lot of institutional knowledge you wouldn't find in the more common DIY bookbinding videos. I learned about many nuances of the craft (paper has graind direction and that matters!). I also learned by trying (your cover can warp in ugly way!). 

The first sewn book with multiple signatures I made was RUNE solo game. I wanted to take it to a vacation and play it ther. Long story short, I dind't manage to assemble it in time and ended up reading a digital version. I still bound the book later just to practice. The cover is quick&dirty and doesn't use proper boadrds for cover (just a card stock) so there endedup being quite a bit of warping.

After that, I made several one section pamphlets with hard cover, trying to use better boards and improve the technique.

I also made a small sketchbook (using premade text-block) to practice book covering.

Finally, I get to my last creation. This time I tried to do everything properly: the paper with the correct grain direction, nice 2mm thick boards, bookbinders cloth and even a bit advanced mix for glue. I took my digital copy of [Magical Industrial Revolution by Skerpless][mir] (which is amazing, by the way) and chose to use [Square Back Bradel Binding](https://youtu.be/rrjU0-c9Nl0) while using a bit different sewing method than in the video and doing the cover a bit differently. I am pretty happy with the result, even though it has its flaws. A bit more photes from the process follow.

## Does it make sense?

Let me make this clear. This is certainly not practical nor cheap way how to get a physical book. If you can get a POD (print on demand) copy, it'll be most likely cheaper and surelly less work for you. I enjoy making things with my hands and there is a very nice meditative aspect in most of the steps of the process. I also enjoy a lot learning and improving new skils. It's not very likely this is going to be my long-term hobby, but I am quite pleased to have bookbinding in my skillset. It's quite sure that my family is going to get DIY notepads and books for the next big gift-giving holiday in December.
