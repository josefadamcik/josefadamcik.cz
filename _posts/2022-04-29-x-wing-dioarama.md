Another Bandai kit of a vehicle from StarWars. Crashed after an emergency landing.

The previous Star Wars vehicle I built was [Star Wars Snowspeeder][snowspeeder] which I eventually placed flying over a piece of [snowy terrain][snowspeederterrain].


For the X-wing, I wanted to do something different and decided to go with a heavily damaged, crashed vehicle.

## Making the vehicle

{% include gallery.html galleryname="xwing" %}

## Building the terrain

As with my [previous simple piece of terrain for the Gaslands vehicle][gaslands], I have to mention the Youtube channel [Boylei Hobby Time][boyleihobbytime]. I am basically trying to reproduce roughly his process.

## Finished

Beauty shots!

I am quite happy with the result. I tried a lot of new techniques and learned a lot. I am certainly going to continue creating dioramas and sceneries for my models. 

## What's next?

Now to decide which one of the kits sitting on my shelf is going to be the next one. AT-AT? AT-ST? B-Wing? Or Razor Crest? Don't know! If you are curious, I share progress on [Twitter][joseftwitter] and [Instagram][josefinstagram]
