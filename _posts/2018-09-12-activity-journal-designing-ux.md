It this part I am going to dive into a short and crude design phase for the Activity Journal application.

{%- include post_series.html -%}



## Purpose of this phase

My dear reader shall be reminded: this is a training application. This application may not be even released. I am working on it solely in order to train some skills and explore some technologies as I already explained [in the first part of this series]({% post_url 2018-08-27-activity-journal-app-idea %}).

The purpose of this part is to explore some ideas about application's user interface and create some initial notion of the product I am going to build. This design phase is not supposed to be thorough and the resulting design won't be set in a stone. I am going to practice iterative development[^1] and TDD and decisions will be made as the development progresses. 

However, it's good to have some starting point, some vision which would allow me to asses size of the project and would help me to start development.

I will use a pen and paper for hand-drawn diagrams and wireframes, so please excuse my drawing. I am not a skilled drawer at all. But still it's the most accessible method for me. There is a plenty of nice design tools out there, but I don't have any nice wireframing tool of choice at the moment, and I don't want to get lost in a "tool evaluation paralysis".

## Navigation flow

This is just simple draft of a navigation graph that crudely captures screens and navigation between them. This may even change before we reach the end of this article.

## Timeline

Timeline is the most important screen in the application and user will spend most of his time there. It's also the hardest screen to design.
