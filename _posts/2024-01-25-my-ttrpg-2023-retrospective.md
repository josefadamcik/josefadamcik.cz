A year and few moths ago I wrote about [my personal renaissance of pen and paper games][pnp]. Long story short, I shared, how I returned to the hobby after many years without even remotely engaging it and how amazed I am by the amount of amazing games and adventures that are available nowadays. I had been running a Mausritter campaing for two people back then, trying to figure out [solo gaming][ironsworn] and slowly dipping my feet into playing with people, be it trough PbP (playb-by-post), online play through voice/video and I had hoped I could find some people to playi in person as well.

To put things in a better context: I live in Berlin, English is my second language and my German is third and I am far from being fluent. I also struggle with social anxiety which hinders me imensely when it comes to seeking new people and interacting with them (it's not an accident that most of the hobies captured on this blog are things I can do alone at home). Even playing in Play-by-post was anxiety triggering and way out of my comfort zone. 

For the last year, I decided to use my obsession by TTRPGs as a motivation to start overcoming the anxiety. The plan was to repeatedly expose myself until I get more comfortable in those situations. This involved playing and even running PbP games at the begining, then adding online one-shots through StartPlaying and some discord communities and eventually joining in open table campaigns. The big goal was to start attengind in person games organised by a community of people here in Berlin. 

Looking back I must say I not only suceeded but even surprised myself by how big progress I made. I started keeping a log of games the end of the Sepember (unfortuntaelly I didn't have that idea sooner) and just for the last 3 and a half months I played in *25* games. From that, six of them were in person with the Berlin community, three were run by me in person for my partner and a friend, and one was run by me online. Even the months before were pretty intensive. There were weeks when I had 3 or 4 games in a week. I estimate I must have played between 50 and 60 games last year at least. Apart from that, I had run one PbP of Starforged, I have been running a PbP of Blades in the Dark and I participated in several other PbP games. 

And what were the games I have been playing? I'll just make a simple list. 

- Blades In The Dark
- Lovercrafesque
- Electric Bastionland
- Mausritter
- Vaults of Vaarn
- Cairn
- The mall
- Mothership
- Coriolis
- MÃ¶rk Borg
- Dath in Space
- Frontire Scum
- CyBorg
- Corp Borg
- ICRPG
- System Shutdown
- Brindlewood Bay
- Public Access
- The Between
- Bump in the dark
- Apocalypse Keys
- Wanderhome
- Troika!
- Starforged
- Liminal Horror

## Solo playing

Thanks to the overwhelmeing number of games I had with other people, I didn't have that much need or opportunities to play solo. So my Starforged campaigns were mostly left forgotton. I played [Miru][miru] by the end of the year and I might write a short review soon. I also upgraded my solo setup at the start of this year and started new character in Starforged, but that's also a topic for another post. 

## Me as GM, Conductor, Keeper, Warden, Guide and whatever

My humble two player in person group finished their Mausritter campaing during the first half of the year. We played a Liminal Horror - The Mall and recently started a campaing of Brindlewood Bay. 

Apart from that, I run one Starforged session and one Mausritter session online. 

I am very interested in running more games. Of course, it is more intimidating and demading (mainly for a person struggling with social anxiety) than being just a player. 

## Me as writer. 

After we published (digitally) a simple addon for Mausritter [The Whites][thewhitesitch] ([I wrote a devlog about it here.][thewhites]), we also made a whole adventure for the [Winter has come Mausritter Jam][jam] called [Chrismous Forever][chrismous] which have been published and the begginign of 2023. I really enjoyed coming up with all the ideas and learning thes skills to put it together. The only thing I regret is that I didn't write more during the last year.

## Plans for 2024

Three pillars in this regard:

- Keep plaiying the games, meeting new people and develop new friendshisps.
- Run games, more and more and more so it becomes a as normal activity as playing become for me now.
- Write more and try to publish more. Mainly adventures and other supplements.
